# Introduction


Covid19, since its inception, has had a huge impact on people's life. Since different governments have announced lock-down to confine people at home to mitigate the spread of the disease, people have turned to social media to express their concerns and their feelings about the situation. An insight into the mindset of the people is a valuable commodity at dire times such as these. Analysis of this frail yet testing phase can give helpful and important insights in to the situation which would surely lead to better and informed decisions at higher levels to curb and contain not only the deadly disease but the rising panic and frustration. In this project, sentiment analysis is done on Covid19 related tweets from different parts of the world which is essentially a test classification problem. Accuracy is tested through various classifiers, such as Naive Bayes,Decision Tree,SVC  to capture more contextual information.
